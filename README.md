## Warwick Beamer Template

An *unofficial* reimplementation of new Warwick Brand Powerpoint presentation slides style as a Beamer template for LaTeX.

Featuring automatic negative space cutout generation using TikZ.

The template has a few customisable options such as adding a footer image, subtitles, alternate colour schemes and adding the University of Warwick text below the word Warwick on the title slide.

An [example PDF](https://github.com/afinetapestry/Warwick-Beamer-Template/files/977562/presentation.pdf) is available.

Built as a template rather than a beamer theme because of the large amount of TikZ needed to dynamically generate the negative space cutouts. However I would probably accept a pull request to change this.

If you'd like a slightly more accurate look then download `ProbaPro-Regular.otf` for free from https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/mint-type/proba-pro and place into a `fonts/` folder, the template will then pick it up.
