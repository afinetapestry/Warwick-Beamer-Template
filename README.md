Another *unofficial* LaTeX Beamer template for the new Warwick Brand.

The template has a few customisable options such as adding a footer image:

Built as a template rather than a beamer theme because of the large amount of TikZ needed to dynamically generate the negative space cutouts. However I would probably accept a pull request to change this.

If you'd like a slightly more accurate look then download `ProbaPro-Regular.otf` for free from https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/mint-type/proba-pro and place into a `fonts/` folder, the template will then pick it up.
